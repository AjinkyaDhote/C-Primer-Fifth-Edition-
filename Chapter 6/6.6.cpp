///Parameters are automatic objects which are required for a function to execute. The parameter list to a funciton can be empty also.
///A local variable is like a helper variable defined inside a function. It is initialized when the function starts executing and 
///goes out of scope when the fucntion execution ends.
///A local static variable has its lifetime till the program ends and not when the function ends. They are intialized before the first time
///execution passes through the objects definition.
