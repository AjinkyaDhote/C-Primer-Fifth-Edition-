//Making a class or a function friend is useful when the class wants to
//give acces of its private members. This helps in keeping the private
//members encapsulated and does not expose them to the user.

//Making a lot of classes or functions friend says a lot about the design
//of the class. Friend should be applied only when necessary. Using it a lot of
//times means that the private members are not encapsulated correctly and the
//design of the class is not correct.
